# Effects of Randomized Redistricting on Congressional Balance of Power

## Background
The concept of redistricting is a popular topic in discussions about congressional representation in the United States. Parties in power often resort to "[gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering)" - the act of re-drawing district boundaries to gain an advantage in the balance of representation. The purpose of this project is to explore how representation in the U.S. House of Representatives shifts from randomizing the redistricting process.

## Updates & Project Timeline

- **December 2018** - implement clustering algorithm (still TBD) to partition each state into congressional districts
